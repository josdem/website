Here you can find all information regarding how configure JMetadata code in your environment..

== Introduction

Usually it's not enough only download the source code and running, so this section was created by supporting all issues regarding running JMetadata from eclipse IDE as application and as a Unit or Integration testing.

== To the developers

* Is my intention that you can take advantage from this code using it as a example resource.
* I'll be honored if you would like to extend this code or do some advice.
* Jmetadata is still work in progress so, there are some issues that I'm working on.
* I was trying to reduce the number of bugs using JUnit and Integration test, but certainly there are some bugs detected, those are in the issues section, but feel free to add a new one.

In order to set up you environment I recommend you
