= Refactoring

== What is refactor?

* Refactoring is the process of changing a software system in such a way that it does not alter the external behavior of the code yet improves its internal structure.
* It is a disciplined way to clean up code that minimizes the chances of introduce bugs.
* In essence when you refactor you are improving the design of the code after it has been written.

== Why do I need refactoring?

* Programs that are hard to read are hard to modify
* Programs that have duplicated logic are hard to modify
* Programs with complex conditional logic are hard to modify

_Martin Fowler's reasons_

* The only way to go fast in software development is to keep your code clean
* We are authors
* In software, 80% or more of what we do is quaintly called "maintenance"

_Robert C. Martin's reasons_

== When I should do refactoring?

* Refactor when you add function
* Refactor when you need to fix a bug
* Refactor when you do a code review

== What do I need to refactor?

* A solid test cases
* Be a self-organized programmer
* Trust in tools that can help you

== When I should not refactor?

* When you do not have sufficient test coverage
* When you spend too much time adding functionality
* When is really difficult to test the code
* When any change causes failures in unexpected ways

== Bad smells in code

_If stinks, change it_

You will have to develop you own sense of how many instance variables are too many instance variables and how many lines of code in a method are too many lines
