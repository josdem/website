<h1>Replace conditional with polymorphism</h1>
<p>The essence of polymorphism is that it allows you to avoid writting an explicit conditional when you have objects whose behavior varies depending on their types.<br/>
Polymorphism gives you many advantages. The biggest gain occurs when this same set of conditions appears in many places in the program. if you want to add a new type, you have to find and update all the conditionals, but with sublcasses you just create a new subclass and provide the appropiate methods.<br/>
Before you can begin with <i>Replace Conditional With Polymorphism</i> you need to have the necessary inheritance structure.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
I will show you the traditional example of employee payment.
