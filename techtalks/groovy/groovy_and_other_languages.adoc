= Comparison between Groovy and other languages

Groovy is very assertive, let's compare the different mechanisms to obtain today's date in varioys languages to demonstrate it

----
import java.util.*; //Java
Date today = new Date(); //Java

today = new Date() //Groovy

require = 'date' #Ruby
today = Date.new #Ruby

import java.util._ //Scala
var today = new Date //Scala

(import '(java.util.Date)') :Clojure
(def today (new Date)) :Clojure
(def today (Date.)) :Clojure
alternative :Clojure
----

The Groovy solution is short, precise and more compact than regular Java. Groovy doesn't need to import the java.util package or specify the Date type.
