= Grails Example Project (Downloader stat)

Simple project with Grails

== Project user story

As application owner I want to deliver my application installer so the client can download it.

=== Acceptance Criteria

* I need to know how many downloads I have by installer
* Installers are Linux, Ubuntu, Mac and Windows
* I need to know what is the client IP address

As first step, I'm going to create a project as follow:

----
grails create-app operating-system-downloader-stat
----

Next, I'm going to create a Domain as follow:

grails create-domain-class com.tim.Downloader

This domain Downloader will store download stats by operating system, it looks like this:

[source,groovy]
----
1 package com.tim
 2
 3 class Downloader {
 4   Date dateCreated
 5   String address
 6   InstallerType type
 7
 8   static constraints = {
 9     address blank:false,size:5..255
10   }
11
12 }
----
